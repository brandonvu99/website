  - Why that domain name?
    - I'm gay as fuck lol
    - 20% of the cost of the domain name goes to LGBT causes (cite this please)
    - "brandonis.gay" looked too much like "brandonis" (Adonis?) + "gay" instead of "brandon" + "is" + "gay", and "brandons.gay" could be interpretted "brandon's" (possessive) + "gay" (brandon's gay what? brandon's gay flag? brandon's gay walk???) instead of "brandon's" (contraction with "is") + "gay"

    - lgbt pride is still important today because many kids are still ousted by their own families for being different (link to trevor project). we need to normalize queerness (which sounds contrary given "queer" means different)
